{"name":"Gillespie-cellular-automaton","tagline":"Simulating ecological processes in discrete and continuous time","body":"# Introduction\r\nIn this project, we sought to understand the effect of simulating spatial ecological processes in discrete and continuous time. To do this, we simulated birth-death processes on a regular square lattice in continuous time employing a spatial version of the Gillespie algorithm, and in discrete time using a range of cellular automata algorithms.
